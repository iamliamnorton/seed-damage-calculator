  This tool uses regression coefficients (crop stand upon fertilizer rate) that were developed using published studies from North America. Coefficients are adjusted for soil texture and soil moisture based on data collected under standardised conditions.<br />
  The tool uses the equation:<br /><br />
  <strong>F = 30S (-T)/CRMX</strong><br /><br />
  Where:<br />
  F = fertilizer material (lb/ac or kg/ha).<br />
  S = seed furrow opening (in or cm).<br />
  T = tolerated stand loss, as a percent, due to fertilizer applied with seed over typical stands, where no fertilizer is applied.<br />
  C = negative regression coefficient for the selected crop X fertilizer (%/lb/ac or %/kg/ha).<br />
  R = row spacing (in or cm).<br />
  MX = planting soil moisture and soil texture coefficients.<br />
