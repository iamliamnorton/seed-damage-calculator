<h2>Soil Moisture</h2>
<p>The values used in the calculations are based on approximate soil moisture values. The indices used to convert to moist or dry soil were derived from a borderline soil moisture content which was 18% w/w (around 20% w/v). So, moist conditions are where the soil is more than approximately 30% w/w while and dry soil is approximately &lt;20% of field capacity.<p>

<h2>Soil Texture</h2>
<p>Standard soil texture classes are referred to, with light soils (sands, sandy loams) being around 80-100% sand, 0-10% silt and 0-10% clay. Medium textured soils (loamy sands, loams) being25-50% sand, 30-50% silt and 10-30% clay. Heavy textured soils (clay loams, clays) are typically 0-45% sand, 0-45% silt and 50-100% clay.</p>

<h2>Seed Furrow Opening</h2>
<p>Seed Furrow Opening is the planter seed-slot width and reflects the amount of mixing of the soil and fertilizer within the furrow. For most row crop planters, a value of 1 inch (2.5 cm) is generally assumed. For drills, the width should be given in the equipment manual or measured at the opener. It is assumed that fertilizer is spread within this width as well; therefore, the wider the value the less concentrated the fertilizer, and therefore less seed damage. Furrow opening will also be affected by operating speed, operating depth and soil conditions. Very narrow furrow openings will generally mean little mixing of soil and fertilizer, while wide openings will mean more mixing. Some typical furrow openings are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    5 inch (12.5 cm) wide share will typically give a seed spread of 2.5 inches (6.5 cm)
  </li>
  <li>
    2.5 inch (6.5 cm) wide share will typically give a seed spread of 2 inches (4.6 cm)
  </li>
  <li>
    1.5 inch (4 cm) wide spear point will typically give a seed spread of 1 inch (2.5 cm)
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tolerated Stand Loss</h2>
<p>Tolerated Stand Loss (%) is the percent stand loss over typical stands when no fertilizer is applied with seed. For example, if 5% tolerated stand loss is entered, this would indicate a producer's tolerance of 5% maximum reduction in plant stand due to seed-placed fertilizer over the producer's typical stand without added fertilizer.  If, for example, 30,000 seeds are planted and a typical stand loss is 3%, we have 30,000 * 0.97 * 0.95 = 27,645 : (27,645 plants / 30,000) = 92% or an 8% tolerated stand reduction.<br />
The higher the value entered (in this case 5%), the more risk the producer is willing to take in stand reduction due to added seed-placed fertilizer.  Of course, corn is much more sensitive to stand reduction than soybean or small grain, which can partially compensate for lower stands.  Whereas stand reductions of greater than 5-10 % may cause yield reductions with corn, yield reductions with soybean or small grain may not occur until stand reductions are greater than 20 to 50% of seeds planted.</p>

<h2>Seed Bed Utilization</h2>
<p>Seed Bed Utilization (%) is the ratio of the width of the seed and fertilizer spread under the seeding point divided by the width between the seeding rows.  It provides information on how concentrated the fertilizer band is likely to be where the seed is placed. Wide rows and narrow furrow openings will have low seed bed utilization ratios, and so a higher potential for seedling damage. Narrow rows with high disturbance shares or points will have higher seed bed utilization ratios and a lower potential for seedling damage.</p>
